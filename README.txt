Logistic Regression is Classification algorithm commonly used in Machine Learning. It allows categorizing data into discrete classes by learning the relationship from a given set of labeled data. 

In this , I had created simple array(size of tumour) and applied logistic_Reg ML Algo to find whether Input from user(size of tumour) is Cancerous or not.

you can apply same code on data-set.
